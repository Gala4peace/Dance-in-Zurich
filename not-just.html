    <h2>sunday with...SILVIO GRAND </h2>
    <p> Silvio Grand and his partner Mayra Galante have been around the world. They have performed in 20 countries. </p>
    <p> From Luna Park in Buenos Aries, Argentina to the Kremlin Theater in Moscow, Russia. They have performed in festivals and taught students in seminars throughout Europe, Asia, Central America, and the United States. Their image has been the international trademark for such companies as CitiBank, Bridge stone, Milonga Liquer, TeLeFe Satelital, and the Argentine channel Solo Tango.
      Silvio Grand was born in the 'Paris of the West' Buenos Aires. The city where the tango was born.</p>
    <p>When asked, what is it that motivates someone internationally renowned for strength, fluidity, and mastering a difficult dance movement, Silvio responded with his own question...
Silvio: Qué es lo que sueño (What do you dream)?</p>
    <blockquote>A good friend once told me that the most important thing we need to do in our lives is ask the right questions of ourselves. </blockquote>

      <p>The people who achieve things seem to ask the right questions. Silvio Grand knows achievement on an internationally competitive scale. Is the dream the motivation?</p>
      <blockquote> Motivation is such a beautiful word. I think it is the key to happiness maybe? I am always in search of motivations because they are the engine of life.</blockquote>

      <p> Since the first class I took, I realized that Tango would be one of the most strongest and enduring influences in my life. I fell in love with the embrace of a woman and how creative you can be when dancing. The range of emotions you can display through it is amazing.</p>
      <p>Then it gets deeper and beyond the dance itself. I love and admire the poetry, didactics, and pedagogy of Tango. I love to teach it and pass along what I know to my students.</p>
